# gitCollaborationGroup10

# The first two merges are fast forward merges, as the original branch that we branched off did not have any changes before we merged 
# back into it. This means that all the changes can be accepted, and there is no risk for a conflict because only one branch had been modified. 

# In the conflict branch, the conflict created is that the title of the index.html file will be changed to "This is the develop branch" in the develop branch, and "This is the conflict branch" in the conflict branch.

# In a scenario where there is no conflict, a paragraph will be added to both branches with the text "This will not cause a conflict." Because both branches will contain this, there will be no conflict regarding the two branches.
